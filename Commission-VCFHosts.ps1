.SYNOPSIS
    Commissions ESXi hosts into SDDC Manager as part of a VMware Cloud Foundation 9
    deployment.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads the commissioning CSV produced by HostPrep.ps1 and commissions all hosts
    into SDDC Manager in a single batch via the REST API.

    Workflow
    --------
      1. Read host FQDNs, thumbprints and detected storage types from the CSV
      2. Prompt for SDDC Manager FQDN, username and password
      3. Authenticate and retrieve a Bearer token
      4. Detect SDDC Manager version via GET /v1/sddc-managers
      5. Retrieve available network pools and prompt for selection
      6. Display per-host storage type from CSV -- no prompting; edit the CSV
         StorageType column before running if any value needs changing
         (VSAN_ESA and VVOL must always be set manually in the CSV)
      7. Prompt for the ESXi root password (required by SDDC Manager)
      8. Save sanitised JSON payload to disk (password masked)
      9. Validate hosts via POST /v1/hosts/validations
         - Flattens nested VCF 9 check structure to get per-host results
         - Prints per-check output with PASS/FAIL/WARN icons and error detail
         - Saves full validation response JSON to disk
         - Writes dark-mode HTML validation report and opens it in the browser
         - Aborts on failure (if -ValidateOnly: exits without commissioning)
     10. Commission hosts via POST /v1/hosts
     11. Poll task every 15 seconds until SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, or timeout
     12. Query GET /v1/hosts to retrieve the SDDC Manager host UUID per host
     13. Print colourised per-host summary table with host UUIDs
     14. Write dark-mode HTML commissioning report and results CSV; open in browser

    CSV Format (produced by HostPrep.ps1)
    --------------------------------------
    FQDN,Thumbprint,StorageType
    esxi01.vcf.lab,SHA256:abc123...,VSAN
    esxi02.vcf.lab,SHA256:def456...,VMFS_FC

    StorageType is detected per host by HostPrep.ps1 (VMFS_FC and NFS are
    auto-detected; everything else defaults to VSAN). Edit the column before
    running this script if VSAN_ESA or VVOL is intended.

    Output Files
    ------------
    All files are written next to the script with a timestamp prefix:
      Commission_<ts>_Payload.json          Sanitised JSON payload (always)
      Commission_<ts>_ValidationResponse.json  Raw SDDC Manager response (always)
      Commission_<ts>_ValidationReport.html  Validation HTML report (always)
      Commission_<ts>_Report.html           Commissioning HTML report (on success)
      Commission_<ts>_Results.csv           Per-host results with UUIDs (on success)

    Validation Report
    -----------------
    The HTML validation report includes:
      - Stat cards: overall status, pass/warn/fail counts (wrapper check excluded)
      - Per-host summary: actual PASS/FAIL/WARN status per host with error message
      - Full check table: all leaf checks with nested detail expanded inline

.PARAMETER CsvPath
    Path to the commissioning CSV produced by HostPrep.ps1.
    Prompted interactively if not supplied.

.PARAMETER SddcManager
    FQDN of the SDDC Manager appliance.
    Prompted interactively if not supplied.

.PARAMETER TimeoutMinutes
    Maximum minutes to wait for the commission task to complete. Default: 30.

.PARAMETER ValidateOnly
    Runs POST /v1/hosts/validations and exits without commissioning. Writes the
    HTML validation report and saves the payload and response JSON to disk.
    The ESXi root password is still required by SDDC Manager for validation.

.PARAMETER SkipCertificateCheck
    Ignore TLS certificate errors when connecting to SDDC Manager.
    Useful in lab environments with self-signed certificates.

.PARAMETER SavePayload
    Always save the sanitised JSON payload to disk. By default the payload is
    saved on every run; this switch existed before that behaviour was made the
    default and is retained for compatibility.

.PARAMETER ReportPath
    Path for the HTML commissioning report. Defaults to the script folder:
    Commission_<timestamp>_Report.html.

.PARAMETER OutputCsvPath
    Path for the results CSV. Defaults to the script folder:
    Commission_<timestamp>_Results.csv.

.PARAMETER PayloadPath
    Path for the sanitised JSON payload. Defaults to the script folder:
    Commission_<timestamp>_Payload.json.

.PARAMETER ValidateReportPath
    Path for the HTML validation report. Defaults to the script folder:
    Commission_<timestamp>_ValidationReport.html.

    Changelog:
        1.0.0 - Initial release. Reads HostPrep CSV, authenticates to SDDC Manager,
                retrieves network pools, validates and commissions hosts, polls task
                to completion and prints colourised result summary.
        1.1.0 - After task completion, query GET /v1/hosts to retrieve
                SDDC Manager host UUIDs per commissioned host; HostID
                column added to summary table and printed in footer
        1.2.0 - Added -ValidateOnly switch: runs POST /v1/hosts/validations
                and prints a full per-check breakdown per host without
                commissioning; validation results now always printed with
                pass/fail/warn icons regardless of mode
        1.3.0 - Added HTML dark-mode commissioning report and results CSV
                after each run; -ReportPath and -OutputCsvPath parameters
                added; Write-CommissionReport and Write-CommissionCsv
                helper functions added
        1.4.0 - Storage type is now per-host from the CSV (detected by
                HostPrep.ps1); interactive per-host override prompt at
                runtime replaces the single batch-level storage prompt
        1.5.0 - On validation failure: sanitised JSON payload (password
                masked) and full validation response always saved to disk;
                -SavePayload switch saves payload on every run regardless;
                -PayloadPath parameter controls output path; per-check
                output now drills into nested validation checks and prints
                all available error/message properties per check
        1.6.0 - Added Write-ValidationReport: dark-mode HTML report generated
                after -ValidateOnly runs (pass or fail) and after validation
                failure during normal runs; shows per-check results with
                nested check detail, host list, overall status, and SDDC
                Manager metadata; -ValidateReportPath parameter added
        1.7.0 - Fixed Get-SddcManagerVersion: now queries GET /v1/sddc-managers
                (correct endpoint, returns elements[].version) with fallback
                to GET /v1/system/about; resolves "Unknown" version display
        1.8.0 - Fixed validation failure detection: was checking executionStatus
                which SDDC Manager always sets to COMPLETED even when checks
                fail; now checks validationChecks[].resultStatus directly;
                payload and validation response always saved to disk regardless
                of outcome; per-check drilling extended to 3 levels deep and
                covers checkItems property; executionStatus and check counts
                printed for transparency
        1.9.0 - Write-ValidationReport rebuilt: per-host failure summary table
                added at the top showing which hosts have issues and the
                specific failure messages extracted from nested checks; nested
                check rendering refactored into recursive helper functions;
                all HTML reports auto-open in the default browser after writing
        2.0.0 - Fixed failure message extraction for SDDC Manager VCF 9 API
                response structure: error detail is in errorResponse.message
                and host FQDN in errorResponse.context.fqdn, not in flat
                properties; Get-CheckFqdn and Get-CheckMessages helpers updated;
                Collect-HostFailures now matches top-level per-host check
                entries directly; console output also shows errorResponse fields
        2.1.0 - Fixed validation check counts: wrapper check "Validating input
                specification" excluded from pass/fail/warn counts as its
                resultStatus differs from the per-host checks beneath it;
                overall status now taken from top-level resultStatus field
                rather than derived from counts; same fix applied to console
                validationFailed logic; footer branding updated with clickable
                blog link and script version in both HTML reports
        2.2.0 - Removed per-host interactive storage type prompt; storage type
                is now read directly from the CSV without prompting; script
                displays detected values and warns on unrecognised types;
                user edits the CSV StorageType column before running if any
                value needs changing
        2.3.0 - Fixed validation check counts and table: per-host checks are
                nested inside wrapper entries in the SDDC Manager VCF 9 API
                response, not siblings; Get-AllLeafChecks recursive helper
                flattens the structure; counts, HTML check rows, console
                summary, and validationFailed detection all now use flattened
                leaf checks
        2.4.0 - Moved Get-AllLeafChecks to Helper Functions region so it is
                accessible from all call sites; removed duplicate inline
                flatten functions (Get-FlatChecks, Flatten-Checks) that were
                scoped inside other functions and caused "not recognized"
                errors at runtime
        2.5.0 - Per-host summary table now shows actual resultStatus (PASS/
                FAIL/WARN) from the matched check object rather than inferring
                pass/fail from extracted failure messages; hosts that passed
                their spec check but failed the overall validation now show
                correctly; message detail shown in appropriate colour per
                status; column renamed from "Issues" to "Validation Result"
        2.6.0 - Fixed per-host status and counts: SDDC Manager sets resultStatus
                on per-host checks based on spec validation only; actual
                connectivity failures are only in errorResponse.message;
                status now derived from message content -- messages not
                matching "succeeded/success/passed" are treated as failures;
                passing hosts whose batch failed due to another host now show
                correctly as PASS with informational message in grey
        2.7.0 - Moved Get-CheckMessages, Get-CheckFqdn and Render-NestedChecks
                to Helper Functions region; they were scoped inside
                Write-ValidationReport and caused "not recognized" errors
                when called from the validation and count logic outside it
        2.8.0 - Fixed "H" cutoff in per-host summary: Get-CheckMessages now
                returns raw unencoded strings; HtmlEncode applied at render
                time only; badge and message detail separated into block
                elements so message wraps correctly below the PASS/FAIL badge
        2.9.0 - Removed informational "Host spec validation succeeded." message
                from PASS rows -- it was showing as a stray "H" due to PS 5.1
                List[string] indexing behaviour; passing hosts now show PASS
                badge only with no extra detail; FAIL rows still show the full
                error message
        3.0.0 - Added TLS certificate bypass for SDDC Manager self-signed/
                internal CA certs: PS 5.1 uses TrustAllCertsPolicy + TLS 1.2;
                PS 6+ uses -SkipCertificateCheck on Invoke-RestMethod; fixed
                host commission payload always serialised as a JSON array by
                wrapping foreach in @() and switching ConvertTo-Json to use
                -InputObject (pipeline unroll caused single-host runs to send
                an object instead of array, resulting in HTTP 400)
        3.0.1 - Gated ICertificatePolicy Add-Type block behind PS version check
                (Major -lt 6); ICertificatePolicy was removed in .NET 6 and
                caused a CS0246 compile error on PowerShell 7+; PS 6+ already
                uses -SkipCertificateCheck per Invoke-RestMethod call
        3.1.0 - Validation timeout increased from 5 to 10 minutes; UNKNOWN
                resultStatus no longer treated as PASSED -- only SUCCEEDED
                maps to PASSED; any other status including UNKNOWN now
                shows as UNKNOWN (grey) and blocks commissioning
        3.1.1 - Fixed per-host effective status fallthrough: hosts with
                UNKNOWN or IN_PROGRESS resultStatus no longer show as PASS;
                only an explicit SUCCEEDED maps to PASS
        3.1.2 - SDDC Manager username prompt now defaults to
                administrator@vsphere.local; press Enter to accept
        3.1.3 - Added maintenance mode check before validation: queries each
                host via ESXi SOAP API; if any are in maintenance mode the
                user is prompted to exit maintenance mode before proceeding
        3.1.4 - Added copy-to-clipboard button next to each SDDC Manager
                Host ID in the commissioning HTML report
