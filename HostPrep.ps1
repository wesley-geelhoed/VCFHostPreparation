<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Prepares ESXi hosts for commissioning into SDDC Manager / VCF 9.

.DESCRIPTION
    When run, the script will interactively prompt for all required input  -- 
    no pre-configuration needed. The following steps are performed for each host:

      1. Connect to the ESXi host using the root account
      2. Ensure NTP servers are configured and the NTP service is running
      3. Apply the required SDDC Manager advanced setting (allowSelfSigned)
      4. Check if the certificate CN matches the host FQDN; if not, enable
         SSH temporarily, regenerate the certificate via
         /sbin/generate-certificates, disable SSH again, then reboot and
         wait for the host to return online
      5. Optionally reset the root account password (asked interactively)

    After all hosts are processed, an HTML report is generated in the same
    folder as the script containing the SHA-256 SSL thumbprint for each host,
    ready to use when commissioning hosts into SDDC Manager.

    Optional Advanced Settings
    --------------------------
    A configuration hashtable near the top of the script ($OptionalAdvancedSettings)
    contains additional advanced settings that are disabled by default. To enable
    any of them, set Enabled = $true and adjust the Value if needed. Currently
    available optional settings:

      - Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup
          The Active Directory group whose members receive full admin access.
          Default value: "ESX Admins"  --  change to match your AD group name.

      - LSOM.lsomEnableRebuildOnLSE
          Enables vSAN automatic rebuild when a device is flagged as LSE.

      - DataMover.HardwareAcceleratedMove / HardwareAcceleratedInit
          Enables SSD TRIM support so ESXi issues UNMAP commands to compatible
          SSDs, allowing drive firmware to reclaim freed blocks.

    Host List File (.txt)
    ---------------------
    The script will prompt for the full path to a plain text file containing
    one ESXi host FQDN per line. Example file contents:

        esxi01.vcf.lab
        esxi02.vcf.lab
        esxi03.vcf.lab

    Lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored.
    Blank lines are also ignored.
    The path can be typed or pasted  --  surrounding quotes are stripped automatically.

    Prerequisites
    -------------
    One-time PowerCLI setup (run once per user account, then never again):

        Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false -Confirm:$false

    This permanently suppresses the VMware CEIP warning that PowerCLI emits
    on first use. Without it the warning will appear every time a new terminal
    is opened, and no script can suppress it reliably from within.

    The Posh-SSH PowerShell module is optional but recommended. Without it,
    certificate regeneration will be skipped and must be performed manually
    on each host. To install it, run:

        Install-Module -Name Posh-SSH -Scope CurrentUser

    If Posh-SSH is not available, the script will print per-host instructions
    at runtime telling you to run /sbin/generate-certificates followed by a
    reboot of the host.

    Password Requirements (VCF 9)
    ------------------------------
    If a password reset is requested, the new password is validated against
    VCF 9 requirements before any host is contacted:
      - 15 to 40 characters
      - At least 1 lowercase letter
      - At least 1 uppercase letter (not as the first character)
      - At least 1 digit (not as the last character)
      - At least 1 special character from: @ ! # $ % ? ^
      - Only letters, digits, and @ ! # $ % ? ^ are permitted
      - At least 3 of the 4 character classes must be present

.PARAMETER NtpServers
    One or more NTP server addresses. Defaults to 'pool.ntp.org'.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Path to write a transcript log. Defaults to the Desktop.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    If set, no changes are made to any host. All actions are logged as
    [DRY RUN] so you can validate the script flow without a real ESXi host.
    Credentials and the host list are still prompted but never used.

.PARAMETER WhatIfReport
    Connects to each host, reads the current certificate CN and SHA-256
    thumbprint, and generates the HTML report  --  without making any other
    changes. Useful for a pre-commissioning inventory pass to collect
    thumbprints before running the full script. Credentials are still
    required to connect.

                HTML report generated after run with thumbprints ready for
                SDDC Manager commissioning; added -ReportPath parameter
        2.9.1 - Fixed HTML report Successful count (Measure-Object + [int]

                button, cert expiry column with amber/red highlighting, and
                Optional Settings column; Expiry stored in $hostResult
        3.3.1 - Fixed thumbprint format: was colon-separated hex (XX:XX:...),
                now SHA256:<base64> to match the SDDC Manager commissioning
                UI exactly; updated HTML report header, column label, and
                note text accordingly and surfaces a
                clear error in $hostResult.Error instead of polluting
                CertRegen with the exception message; a prominent red
                banner is printed immediately on timeout; finally block
                skips Disconnect-VIServer when host never came back to
                avoid the noisy ObjectNotFound error; Timeout added to
                Get-CellColor (red), HTML report Rebooted cell, and legend
                WhatIfReport overallOk logic corrected (NTP/AdvancedSettings
                are Skipped so status now shows correct checkmark); CertRegen
                'OK' in WhatIfReport now shows 'Not needed' not 'Regenerated';
                removed dead-code hostOnline check (Wait-ESXiHostOnline already
                throws on timeout); password reset Y/N prompt skipped during
                WhatIfReport; Posh-SSH warning suppressed during WhatIfReport

        - Enables SSH on the host via PowerCLI (Set-VMHostServiceConfig)
        - Opens an SSH session using Posh-SSH with the supplied root credentials
        - Runs /sbin/generate-certificates
        - Disables SSH again regardless of outcome (try/finally)
        - Returns $true on success, throws on failure

    .PARAMETER VMHost
        FQDN or hostname of the ESXi host (string - needed for SSH connection).

    .PARAMETER VMHostObj
        VMHost object returned by Get-VMHost, used for PowerCLI service control.

    .PARAMETER Credential
        PSCredential for the root account, used to authenticate the SSH session.

        Resets an ESXi account password via ESXCLI v2 with hardened handling.

        - Validates inputs before touching the host

  <strong>Note:</strong> The SSL thumbprint shown is in the <code>SHA256:&lt;base64&gt;</code> format
  as expected by the SDDC Manager commissioning UI. Use these values to verify host identity
  when adding hosts to SDDC Manager during VCF commissioning.
  Thumbprints for hosts where certificate regeneration was performed reflect the <em>new</em> certificate.
  Expiry dates within 90 days are shown in <span class="expiry-warn">amber</span>;
  within 30 days in <span class="expiry-critical">red</span>.
