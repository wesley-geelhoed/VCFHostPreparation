.SYNOPSIS
    Prepares ESXi hosts for commissioning into SDDC Manager / VCF 9.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads a plain text file containing one ESXi host FQDN per line and runs
    through the following steps on each host:

      1. DNS validation  --  forward (A record) and reverse (PTR) lookup
      2. Connect to the host using the root account via PowerCLI
      3. NTP  --  verify NTP servers are configured and ntpd is running
      4. Advanced Settings  --  set allowSelfSigned = true (required by SDDC Manager)
      5. Optional Advanced Settings  --  apply any settings enabled in the
         $OptionalAdvancedSettings block at the top of the script
      6. Storage type detection  --  detect VMFS_FC (FC HBA present) or NFS
         (NFS datastore mounted); defaults to VSAN otherwise. Note: vSAN OSA
         vs ESA cannot be auto-detected on unclaimed hosts -- edit the
         StorageType column in the CSV before running Commission-VCFHosts.ps1
         if VSAN_ESA or VVOL is intended
      7. Certificate regeneration  --  check CN vs FQDN; if mismatched, enable
         SSH temporarily, run /sbin/generate-certificates via Posh-SSH, disable
         SSH, reboot, and wait for the host to return online
      8. Password reset (optional)  --  reset root password to a VCF 9 compliant
         value; always runs last so the existing credential is valid throughout

    After all hosts are processed:
      - A colourised summary table is printed to the console
      - An HTML commissioning report is saved next to the script containing the
        SHA256:<base64> thumbprint for each host (ready to paste into SDDC Manager)
      - A commissioning CSV is saved next to the script for use by the companion
        script Commission-VCFHosts.ps1 to automate the SDDC Manager commissioning step

    Storage Type Detection
    ----------------------
    The storage type per host is detected automatically after connecting:
      - VMFS_FC   : Fibre Channel HBA detected
      - NFS       : NFS datastore mounted
      - VSAN      : default for all other hosts (unclaimed disks)

    vSAN OSA vs ESA cannot be distinguished on a freshly prepped host because
    disks are unclaimed at commissioning time. If VSAN_ESA or VVOL is intended,
    edit the StorageType column in the generated CSV before running
    Commission-VCFHosts.ps1. That script reads the CSV value as-is without
    prompting.

    Optional Advanced Settings
    --------------------------
    Near the top of the script, the $OptionalAdvancedSettings block contains
    extra settings that are disabled by default. Set Enabled = $true to apply:

      - Config.HostAgent.plugins.hostsvc.esxAdminsGroup (string)
          AD group whose members receive full ESXi admin access.
          Default: "ESX Admins"  --  change to match your AD group name.

      - LSOM.lsomEnableRebuildOnLSE (integer, 1/0)
          Enables vSAN automatic rebuild when a device is flagged as LSE.

      - DataMover.HardwareAcceleratedMove / HardwareAcceleratedInit (integer, 1/0)
          Enables SSD TRIM so ESXi issues UNMAP commands to compatible SSDs.

    Host List File
    --------------
    A plain text file with one ESXi FQDN per line. Lines starting with # are
    treated as comments and ignored. Surrounding quotes on the path are stripped
    automatically when pasted.

    Prerequisites
    -------------
    One-time PowerCLI setup (run once per user account):

        Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false -Confirm:$false

    Posh-SSH is optional but required for automated certificate regeneration:

        Install-Module -Name Posh-SSH -Scope CurrentUser

    Without Posh-SSH the script will print per-host manual instructions for
    the certificate step instead of failing.

    VCF 9 Password Requirements
    ---------------------------
    If a password reset is requested the new password is validated before any
    host is touched:
      - 15 to 40 characters
      - At least 1 lowercase letter
      - At least 1 uppercase letter (not as the first character)
      - At least 1 digit (not as the last character)
      - At least 1 special character from: @ ! # $ % ? ^
      - Only letters, digits, and @ ! # $ % ? ^ are permitted
      - At least 3 of the 4 character classes must be present

.PARAMETER NtpServers
    One or more NTP server addresses. Defaults to 'pool.ntp.org'.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Path to write the log file. Defaults to the script directory.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Simulates all steps without making any changes. All actions are logged
    as [DRY RUN]. Useful for validating the script against your environment.

.PARAMETER WhatIfReport
    Connects to each host, reads the certificate CN, thumbprint and expiry,
    then generates the HTML report and CSV without making any changes.
    Useful for a pre-commissioning inventory pass to collect thumbprints.

.PARAMETER ReportPath
    Path for the HTML commissioning report. Defaults to the script folder
    with a timestamp filename: HostPrep_<timestamp>_Report.html.

.PARAMETER CsvPath
    Path for the commissioning CSV consumed by Commission-VCFHosts.ps1.
    Defaults to the script folder: HostPrep_<timestamp>_Commissioning.csv.

          - No characters outside letters, digits, and @ ! # $ % ? ^
          - At least 3 of the 4 character classes must be present
          - Dictionary words should be avoided (cannot be enforced client-side)

    .SYNOPSIS
        Detects the primary storage type of a standalone ESXi host for use

    .DESCRIPTION
        Checks in order: FC HBAs, NFS datastores, then defaults to VSAN.

        vSAN OSA vs ESA cannot be reliably auto-detected on a freshly prepped
        host because disks are unclaimed at commissioning time -- there are no
        disk groups or storage pools yet. The distinction is a deployment design
        choice, not a readable hardware state. If your hosts are intended for
        vSAN ESA, override the storage type interactively in Commission-VCFHosts.ps1
        when prompted, or edit the CSV directly before running that script.

        Valid SDDC Manager storageType values:
          VSAN       - vSAN Original Storage Architecture (OSA)  [default]
          VSAN_ESA   - vSAN Express Storage Architecture -- edit CSV manually
